the app2 is performing well functionally and even follow up questions are being answered in a better way.

app3 is better ui wis but the agent forgets how to use the tool call as the chat progresses and is not really giving relevant folloq up answers.

app4.py is working well i am abl to asl a question it fetched the resumes then i asked for numbers it gave then i asked what about vietnam then i asked all phone numbers it gave .
